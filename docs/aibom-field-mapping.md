# AIBOM Canonical Field & Relationship Mapping

## Scope and Purpose

This document defines the **canonical field and relationship model** used by the AIBOM Generator and how it maps to:

- **CycloneDX 1.6**
- **SPDX 3.0 (AI Profile)**

The goal of this document is to:
- provide a **single source of truth** for what data the tool collects,
- show how each concept maps to both standards,
- enable **clean, maintainable implementation**,
- allow **external reviewers (e.g., SPDX experts)** to validate mapping choices independently of code.

This document is **normative for data modeling**, not for code structure or scoring weights.

---

## How to Read This Document

- **Table 0** defines the **canonical concepts**.  
  This is the authoritative list of fields and relationships the tool understands.

- **Table 1** shows **conceptual coverage** across standards.  
  This is the most important table for reviewers and alignment discussions.

- **Table 2** shows **CycloneDX 1.6 projection details** (tree-based, JSON-path oriented).

- **Table 3** shows **SPDX 3.0 projection details** (graph-based, object + relationship oriented).

Cardinality notation is normalized to UML-style (0..*) across all tables.

Scoring, validation, and emitters operate on the **canonical model**, not directly on these tables.

---

## Standards Covered

- **CycloneDX:** v1.6  
- **SPDX:** v3.0 (AI Profile)

Future versions are expected to be supported by **updating mappings**, not by redefining canonical concepts.

## Technical Implementation Notes (High Level)

- Extractors normalize raw source metadata into a **canonical AIBOM object**.
- The canonical AIBOM object is the **single authoritative internal representation** of all extracted fields and relationships.
- Both **scoring** and **format emitters** consume the canonical AIBOM object independently.
- Scoring evaluates **canonical field and relationship coverage**, independent of any output format.
- Emitters project canonical data into format-specific representations (CycloneDX, SPDX, etc.) using mapping and policy tables.
- Format compliance checks (e.g., required SPDX AI Profile fields) are applied **only during emission**, not during scoring.
- This separation allows standards to evolve without impacting extractors or scoring logic.
