## � Installation & Usage

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run Web Application
Start the local server at `http://localhost:8000`:
```bash
python3 -m src.main
```

### 3. Run via CLI
Generate an AIBOM for a Hugging Face model directly from your terminal:

**Basic Usage:**
```bash
python3 -m src.cli google-bert/bert-base-uncased
```

**Advanced Usage:**
You can specify additional metadata like component name, version, and supplier.
```bash
python3 -m src.cli google-bert/bert-base-uncased \
  --name "My Custom BERT" \
  --version "1.0.0" \
  --manufacturer "Acme Corp" \
  --output "my_sbom.json"
```

**Command Line Options:**

| Option | Shorthand | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `model_id` | | Hugging Face Model ID (e.g., `owner/model`) |
| `--test` | `-t` | Run test mode for multiple predefined models |
| `--output` | `-o` | Custom output file path |
| `--name` | `-n` | Override component name in metadata |
| `--version` | `-v` | Override component version in metadata |
| `--manufacturer` | `-m` | Override component manufacturer/supplier |
| `--inference` | `-i` | Use AI inference for enhanced metadata (requires API key) |
| `--summarize` | `-s` | Enable intelligent description summarization |
| `--verbose` | | Enable verbose logging |

*   Metrics and produced SBOMs are saved to the `sboms/` directory by default.
